GNUBridge is a Contract Bridge program written in Java and available under GNU public license v. 3. My fork enhances its strength of bidding, yet it's not complete. Only Opening - Response - Rebid - Partner's Rebid are implemented, and after this process, the program will bid a PASS. 

Note, this is not the official version of GNU Bridge. But the playing is still the original Double-Dummy solver. You can download a runnable jar file here:
